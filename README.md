# How it works.

- Use 12 splits (1 for every level) 
- Start timeattack -> timer will be startet once onwards is loaded
- A split happens once a new level is loaded
- (You can reset easy, because after you go from main menu to timeattack screen the timer resets)
- Finish the run and the last split is, if current scene switches to main menu
- You have to manually split to remove time

Have fun!
